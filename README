This is my first project working with the inbuit graphical user interface in python called tkinter.

I used it to create a simple alarm clock where you can pick the songs that you wanted to play when the clock hit a certain time.

Although there are a couple errors such as:
- if the time isnt in 24hr format it crashes
- the layout isn't user friendly
- when the program starts, there is an error when selecting the time you want
- the songs have to be downloaded and placed in a specific file for the program to work
- if the time you want the alarm clock to ring at is too big, it crashes
- if the time you want the alarm clock to ring is before the current time, it crashes.
